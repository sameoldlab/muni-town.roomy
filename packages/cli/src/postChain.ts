/**
 * Serial post chain for streamed thinking chunks.
 *
 * The responder streams the model's thinking trace to Roomy while omp is
 * still running, so each chunk post is appended to a promise chain that is
 * only awaited once streaming has finished. That shape has a nasty failure
 * mode: if a post rejects and the chain link is left rejected with no
 * downstream handler, Node treats it as an unhandled rejection and kills the
 * process — which, via the broken pipe, takes the whole `roomy-bridge |
 * respond` pipeline with it and loses the in-flight answer.
 *
 * A `PostChain` closes that hole by construction:
 *
 *  - The chain NEVER rejects. A failed post is logged, counted, and its error
 *    recorded; the chain continues so subsequent chunks (and the final
 *    answer) still get their turn.
 *  - `drain()` always resolves. Callers await it to know every queued post
 *    has settled, then consult `failureCount()`/`firstError()` to decide
 *    whether to warn and continue (the answer is still worth posting) or bail.
 *
 * This is commit a64ad5dd ("attach a rejection handler immediately") done
 * properly: that fix logged the failure but *re-rejected*, so the last link
 * sat unhandled for the whole remaining streaming window — exactly the window
 * a 20s XRPC timeout spans. Rejections are contained here instead.
 *
 * Deliberately no retry: a chunk post that times out has an ambiguous
 * outcome (the appserver may have already appended the event), and sendReply
 * mints a fresh ULID per attempt — retrying would silently duplicate the
 * chunk. Containment keeps the trace intact and the pipeline alive.
