/**
 * Playwright config for app-lite end-to-end tests.
 *
 * Lives in `packages/app-lite` rather than the repo root because the suite
 * tests that package: it needs app-lite's vite dev server, its `.env`-style
 * `PUBLIC_*` runtime vars, and the appserver it pairs with. Both the config
 * and the specs sit beside the code they cover. (The repo root has no
 * test runner for any package — each package owns its own.)
 *
 * The stack is fully hermetic and started by `e2e/launch-stack.ts`:
 * a stub PDS, an in-process appserver in `APPSERVER_TEST_MODE`, seeded
 * fixtures, and `vite dev`. No docker, no real PDS, no network — see that
 * file for why. `webServer` waits on the app-lite origin before any test runs.
