# Progressive Scope Expansion — Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2026-06-12 (updated 2026-07-02; redefined 2026-09-23)
**Status:** Draft
**Packages:** `packages/appserver`, `packages/app-lite`, `packages/sdk`

## Goal

Roomy can usefully manage many kinds of data on a user's PDS, and on a
community PDS via the Arbiter. Requesting all of that access at first login is
overwhelming and uncomfortable for users who do not yet understand what Roomy
can do. So:

1. Put **every scope Roomy might ever want** into `oauth-client-metadata.json`
   (the ceiling), and **dynamically choose the subset actually requested** per
   user and per action in the app.
2. **Store each user's PDS access settings on the appserver**, editable from
   their account settings. A returning user who has already consented to a set
   of scopes gets them requested on first login — not one consent prompt per
   feature per session.
3. When a shipped feature needs a scope an existing session lacks, handle it
   the same way as progressive expansion: a dialogue that names the action and
   asks the user to accept or reject, instead of an unfriendly scope error.

The original motivating example was Bluesky DMs; the first *in-tree* test case
is now **Semble record management** (see "First extension" below).

## Redefinition 2026-09-23 (Meri)

Meri's current statement of the problem widens the original design in four
ways. The mechanism below (tiers, server-side grant tracking, re-auth
round-trip) is unchanged and is still the foundation; these are the additions.

| Addition | Why the draft did not cover it |
|---|---|
| **Editable access settings UI** in user account settings | The draft stored the grant and read it at login, but gave the user no surface to see or change it. Meri: "store users' PDS access settings in the app server and make them editable in their user account settings." |
| **Reactive consent dialogue for newly-shipped features** | The draft's strategy B (`guardedXrpc`) was written as a "later fallback once the exact PDS error shapes are confirmed". Meri wants it in scope: this is the common real case (existing session + a feature that needs a new scope), not an edge case. |
| **Semble records as the first tier** | The draft's first tier was `withDms`, which is not in the tree. Meri names Semble: the space-collection path via the Arbiter exists, the personal-collection action does not. |
| **Phase-per-agent dispatch with stacked PRs** | The draft listed five rollout phases with no rule for who implements them or in what order. Meri: "create a plan for this task that splits it into several phases and then dispatch an agent for each phase as soon as the previous step is implemented. We can use stacked PRs if that's available." |

## How ATProto OAuth Scopes Actually Work

This is the core finding that shapes the design. There are **two scope layers**:

### 1. `clientMetadata.scope` — the ceiling

The maximum set of scopes a client is *allowed* to ever request. The PDS
enforces this server-side (`oauth-provider/src/client/client.ts:294`):

```typescript
if (parameters.scope !== undefined) {
  const declaredScopes = this.metadata.scope?.split(' ')
  for (const scope of parameters.scope.split(' ')) {
    if (!declaredScopes.includes(scope)) {
      throw new InvalidScopeError(
        parameters,
        `Scope "${scope}" is not declared in the client metadata`,
      )
    }
  }
}
```

**Every scope token in an authorization request must exist in the metadata's
scope.** Requesting something outside it → `invalid_scope` error.

### 2. `authorize({ scope })` — the per-request request

Each call to `client.authorize()` may pass a `scope` that overrides
`clientMetadata.scope` for *that* request (`oauth-client.js:177`):

```javascript
scope: options?.scope ?? this.clientMetadata.scope,
```

### 3. Consent screen shows only the requested subset

The PDS consent UI (`oauth-provider-ui/src/components/utils/scope-description.tsx`)
parses the `scope` from the authorization request and renders *only those
permissions*. The user is never shown the full metadata ceiling.

Users may *narrow* granted scopes on the consent screen (e.g. uncheck email),
but can never broaden beyond what the request asked for
(`request-manager.ts:429`):

```typescript
// allows the user to REMOVE scopes from the request, but not to ADD new ones
const newScopes = existingScopes?.filter((s) => allowedScopes.has(s))
```

### 4. Tracking the grant

`OAuthSession.getTokenInfo()` returns the scope the token was actually granted,
including any narrowing the user did:

```typescript
const tokenInfo = await session.getTokenInfo(false);
tokenInfo.scope; // "atproto rpc:... blob:*/*"
```

### 5. No upgrade endpoint

There is **no incremental scope-upgrade endpoint**. Extending scope requires a
full re-authorization round-trip (`authorize` → redirect → `callback`). The
PDS shows consent for only the new/changed permissions.

### 6. Loopback vs public client difference

| | Loopback (dev) | Public (prod) |
|---|---|---|
| Scope lives in | `client_id` query param: `http://localhost?scope=...` | `oauth-client-metadata.json` `scope` field |
| Changing scope | Changes `client_id` → PDS sees a *different client* | `authorize({ scope })` override; client_id stable |
| Progressive extension | New client_id per scope set; old session parallel | Clean: same client, request subset then superset |

For the **public client**, progressive extension works cleanly: keep one
metadata file with the union ceiling, request a subset at login, request more
later. For the **loopback client** (dev only), changing the scope creates a new
client_id; `BrowserOAuthClient.signIn()` with the new scope still produces a
working new session, and the old one is effectively abandoned.

### 7. PDS remembers prior grants (key to server-side tracking)

The PDS tracks OAuth grants per `(client_id, user_did)`. When a client
re-authorizes with a scope that is a **subset of what was previously granted**,
the PDS issues a token without re-prompting. When the scope includes new
permissions not yet granted, the consent screen shows only the delta.

This means: if the appserver remembers the full scope a user previously
approved, the client can request that exact scope on every login. Returning
users get a max-access token with zero prompts. New permissions (added in a
later release) prompt only for the genuinely new scopes.

---

## Design

### Scope tiers

Define named scope tiers in a new `scopes.ts`. The `base` tier matches the
current `OAUTH_SCOPE`. Each additional tier is `base` plus its extras.

```
base      ── current OAUTH_SCOPE (core Roomy functionality)
semble    ── base + network.cosmik.* writes to the user's own repo
withDms   ── base + Bluesky chat RPC scopes   (deferred; not in-tree)
```

`semble` is the first tier that will actually be exercised (Phase 6).
`withDms` stays defined in this plan as the shape a future tier takes, but
nothing in the tree needs it yet, so it is not a rollout phase.

### Metadata ceiling (public client)

`oauth-client-metadata.json`'s `scope` field becomes the **union of all tiers**.
At first login, app-lite requests only `base`. The consent screen shows only
base permissions. When the user first invokes a feature whose scopes are outside
`base` (Semble, then later DMs), app-lite requests that tier; the consent screen
shows only that tier's additions.

### Server-side scope tracking

Store the raw scope string each user has consented to, on the appserver, in the
**readstate database** (`data/roomy-readstate.sqlite`). This DB survives
materialisation schema resets — unlike the main DB, which is wiped and
reconstructed from the Leaf event log. It already holds per-user state
(`read_positions`, `user_thread_activity`) and is the established home for
appserver-owned, per-user, non-reconstructible data.

The stored scope is the **last-granted** scope (most recent consent), not a
high-water mark. This respects explicit consent narrowing — if the user
unchecked a scope on the consent screen, the stored value reflects that, and
the user is not silently re-granted it on next login.
Two new appserver endpoints support this (Phase 4 adds two more — see below):

1. **`space.roomy.auth.getLoginScope`** (query, **unauthenticated**) — takes a
   handle, resolves it to a DID server-side (the appserver already has
   `IdResolver` from `@atproto/identity`), returns the stored scope (or null).
   Called *before* the user has a token, so `signIn()` can include the right
   scope. The `did` in the response saves the client a separate resolution call.

2. **`space.roomy.auth.recordScopeGrant`** (procedure, authenticated) — takes
   the scope string from `getTokenInfo()`, upserts the stored grant for
   `auth.did`. Fire-and-forget — failure is non-fatal; the session works
   regardless, and it self-heals on next login.

**Why unauthenticated for `getLoginScope`:** The whole point is to fetch the
stored scope *before* initiating OAuth, so the `signIn()` call can include the
right scope. There's a chicken-and-egg: you need a token to call authenticated
endpoints, but you need the scope to get a token. Resolving handle→DID
server-side breaks the cycle. The stored scope is not sensitive — it's a list
of public permission token strings (they're in the client metadata). Rate-limit
the endpoint to prevent handle-resolution abuse (the existing `rateLimit.ts`
infrastructure applies).

**Why the raw scope string, not a tier name:** Tiers are a client-side UX
abstraction; the server shouldn't know about `semble` or `withDms`. The raw
string handles consent narrowing correctly and is forward-compatible with new
tiers without schema changes.

**Why `user_did` alone (no client identifier):** There is one app-lite client
today. If we later have multiple clients (desktop, mobile) with different scope
ceilings, add a `client_id` column. Until then, `user_did` PK is sufficient.

### Client-side tracking

On `init()` and after any re-authorization, call `session.getTokenInfo()` and
store the granted scope in `$state`. Expose `hasScope(tier)` so feature gates
can check whether a capability is available before use.

### Re-authorization flow

A `requestScopeExpansion(tier)` function persists the desired tier to
`sessionStorage`, then calls `login(handle, { scope: SCOPE_SETS[tier] })`,
which redirects to the PDS. On return, `init()` detects the pending tier,
refreshes the granted scope from the token, and verifies the expansion
succeeded. The same `init()` that runs after every callback also calls
`recordScopeGrant`, so expansions persist for future re-logins automatically.

## File Structure

### Appserver

```
packages/appserver/src/
  db/
    readStateSchema.sql                              ← ADD user_oauth_grants table
    readStateDb.ts                                   ← Bump READSTATE_SCHEMA_VERSION
  handlers/
    space.roomy.auth.getLoginScope.ts                ← NEW — unauthenticated query
    space.roomy.auth.recordScopeGrant.ts             ← NEW — authenticated procedure
    space.roomy.auth.getScopeSettings.ts             ← NEW (Phase 4) — per-tier state
    space.roomy.auth.setScopeSettings.ts             ← NEW (Phase 4) — record intent
  index.ts                                           ← Register new routes
```

### App-lite

```
packages/app-lite/src/lib/
  scopes.ts                  ← NEW — scope tier definitions + helpers + reconcileScope()
  config.ts                  ← MODIFIED — drop OAUTH_SCOPE (moved to scopes.ts)
  auth.svelte.ts             ← MODIFIED — grant tracking + expansion flow + server sync
  client.ts                  ← MODIFIED — add pxUnauth() for unauthenticated XRPC
  scope-guard.ts             ← NEW (Phase 5) — isInsufficientScopeError + guardedXrpc
  components/
    ScopeGate.svelte         ← NEW — reusable "needs more permissions" gate
    ScopeConsentDialogue.svelte ← NEW (Phase 5) — friendly accept/reject prompt
  mutations/
    semble-personal.ts       ← NEW (Phase 6) — write network.cosmik.card to own repo
packages/app-lite/src/routes/user/settings/
  scopes/+page.svelte        ← NEW (Phase 4) — user-facing access settings
packages/app-lite/static/
  oauth-client-metadata.json ← NEW — public client metadata (union ceiling)
```

### SDK

No change required — `scope` already flows through `login()` → `signIn()` →
`authorize()`. The server-side integration is entirely in app-lite's
`auth.svelte.ts` and the new appserver endpoints.

### Lexicons

Four new lexicon JSON files (two per endpoint pair):
```
packages/sdk/src/schemas/lexicons/
  space.roomy.auth.getLoginScope.json
  space.roomy.auth.recordScopeGrant.json
  space.roomy.auth.getScopeSettings.json        (Phase 4)
  space.roomy.auth.setScopeSettings.json        (Phase 4)
```

> **Note:** `APPSERVER_RPCS` is currently duplicated in `config.ts`. When this
> lands, move the single source of truth into `scopes.ts` and have `config.ts`
> import it (or vice-versa) to avoid drift.

### 2. `src/lib/config.ts` (modified)

Remove the `OAUTH_SCOPE` export and the inline `APPSERVER_RPCS` (now in
`scopes.ts`). `CONFIG` keeps its NSID fields — `scopes.ts` imports them.

```diff
- export const OAUTH_SCOPE = [ ... ].join(" ");
```

### 3. Appserver: `user_oauth_grants` table

New table in the **readstate DB** (`packages/appserver/src/db/readStateSchema.sql`):

```sql
create table if not exists user_oauth_grants (
  user_did       text primary key,
  granted_scope  text not null,          -- raw scope string from getTokenInfo()
  updated_at     integer not null default (unixepoch() * 1000)
) strict;
```

Bump `READSTATE_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `readStateDb.ts`.

### 4. Appserver: `getLoginScope` handler

```typescript
// packages/appserver/src/handlers/space.roomy.auth.getLoginScope.ts

import { idResolver } from "../xrpc/auth.ts";
import { openReadStateDb } from "../db/readStateDb.ts";
import { XrpcError } from "../xrpc/errors.ts";
import type { AuthCtx, QueryHandler, QueryParams } from "../xrpc/types.ts";

interface GetLoginScopeResult {
  did: string;
  scope: string | null;
}

export const getLoginScopeHandler: QueryHandler<
  QueryParams,
  GetLoginScopeResult
> = async (params: QueryParams, _auth: AuthCtx) => {
  const handle = params.handle;
  if (typeof handle !== "string" || handle === "") {
    throw new XrpcError(400, "InvalidRequest", "handle is required");
  }

  // Resolve handle → DID using the appserver's existing IdResolver.
  const did = await idResolver.handle.resolve(handle);
  if (!did) {
    throw new XrpcError(404, "NotFound", `Could not resolve handle: ${handle}`);
  }

  // Look up the stored scope grant (if any).
  const readStateDb = openReadStateDb();
  const row = readStateDb
    .prepare("select granted_scope from user_oauth_grants where user_did = ?")
    .get(did) as { granted_scope: string } | null;

  return {
    did,
    scope: row?.granted_scope ?? null,
  };
};
```

> **Note:** This handler is intentionally unauthenticated — `auth.did` will be
> `null`. The XRPC router's `prodAuthVerifier` returns `{ did: null }` when no
> Bearer token is present, and handlers decide what anonymous callers may do.
> This handler ignores `auth` entirely. Rate-limit via `rateLimit.ts` to
> prevent handle-resolution abuse.

### 5. Appserver: `recordScopeGrant` handler

```typescript
// packages/appserver/src/handlers/space.roomy.auth.recordScopeGrant.ts

import { openReadStateDb } from "../db/readStateDb.ts";
import { parseUserDid } from "../xrpc/authGuards.ts";
import { XrpcError } from "../xrpc/errors.ts";
import type { AuthCtx, ProcedureHandler, QueryParams } from "../xrpc/types.ts";

interface RecordScopeGrantBody {
  scope?: unknown;
}

export const recordScopeGrantHandler: ProcedureHandler<
  RecordScopeGrantBody,
  void
> = async (_params: QueryParams, auth: AuthCtx, body: RecordScopeGrantBody) => {
  const userDid = parseUserDid(auth);
  if (userDid === null) {
    throw new XrpcError(401, "AuthRequired", "Authentication required");
  }

  if (typeof body.scope !== "string" || body.scope === "") {
    throw new XrpcError(400, "InvalidRequest", "scope is required");
  }

  const readStateDb = openReadStateDb();
  readStateDb
    .prepare(
      `insert into user_oauth_grants (user_did, granted_scope, updated_at)
       values (?, ?, unixepoch() * 1000)
       on conflict(user_did) do update set
         granted_scope = excluded.granted_scope,
         updated_at = excluded.updated_at`,
    )
    .run(userDid, body.scope);
};
```

### 6. Appserver: route registration

In `packages/appserver/src/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { getLoginScopeHandler } from "./handlers/space.roomy.auth.getLoginScope.ts";
import { recordScopeGrantHandler } from "./handlers/space.roomy.auth.recordScopeGrant.ts";

// Add to the router chain:
const router = new XrpcRouter(prodAuthVerifier)
  .procedure("space.roomy.auth.recordScopeGrant", {
    handler: recordScopeGrantHandler,
  })
  .query("space.roomy.auth.getLoginScope", {
    handler: getLoginScopeHandler,
  })
  // ... existing routes ...
```

### 7. App-lite: `client.ts` — add `pxUnauth()`

```typescript
import { transport } from "@roomy-space/sdk/browser";

const { DirectXrpcClient, resolveAppserverHttpOrigin } = transport;

let directXrpc: InstanceType<typeof DirectXrpcClient> | null = null;
let appserverUrl: string | null = null;

// ... existing px() setup ...

/**
 * Get an unauthenticated XRPC client for endpoints that don't require auth
 * (e.g. getLoginScope, which is called before the user has a token).
 */
export function pxUnauth(): InstanceType<typeof DirectXrpcClient> {
  if (!directXrpc) {
    // If we already have an authenticated client, reuse its URL.
    const url = appserverUrl
      ?? resolveAppserverHttpOrigin(CONFIG.appserverDid);
    // DirectXrpcClient works without a ServiceAuthClient for unauthenticated
    // calls — it just won't attach a Bearer token.
    return new DirectXrpcClient(
      typeof url === "string" ? url : url,
      CONFIG.appserverDid,
      null as any, // no service auth
    );
  }
  return directXrpc;
}
```

> This is a sketch — the exact `DirectXrpcClient` API may need adjustment to
> support a "no auth" mode. The key requirement is: call `getLoginScope`
> without a Bearer token.

### 8. App-lite: `auth.svelte.ts` (modified)

Add grant tracking, a `hasScope()` getter, the expansion flow, and server-side
scope sync.

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@atproto/api";
import {
  login as sdkLogin,
  logout as sdkLogout,
  initSession,
  saveAppserverDid,
  type OAuthSession,
} from "@roomy-space/sdk/browser";
import { CONFIG } from "./config";
import {
  SCOPE_SETS,
  FULL_SCOPE_CEILING,
  hasScopeSet,
  reconcileScope,
  type ScopeSetName,
} from "./scopes";
import { px, pxUnauth } from "./client";

let agent = $state<Agent | null>(null);
let session = $state<OAuthSession | null>(null);
let authenticated = $state(false);
let initializing = $state(true);
let initError = $state<string | null>(null);
let grantedScope = $state<string>("");
let currentHandle = $state<string>("");

const PENDING_EXPANSION_KEY = "pending-scope-expansion";

export const auth = {
  get session() {
    return session;
  },
  get authenticated() {
    return authenticated;
  },
  get initializing() {
    return initializing;
  },
  get initError() {
    return initError;
  },
  /** The scope the current token was actually granted (post user-narrowing). */
  get grantedScope() {
    return grantedScope;
  },
  /** True if the current grant covers the named scope tier. */
  hasScope(tier: ScopeSetName): boolean {
    return hasScopeSet(grantedScope, tier);
  },
};

export async function init() {
  saveAppserverDid(CONFIG.appserverDid);
  try {
    const result = await initSession(CONFIG.appserverDid, {
      port: CONFIG.port,
      scope: SCOPE_SETS.base,
      usePublicClient: CONFIG.usePublicClient,
    });
    if (result) {
      session = result.session;
      agent = result.agent;
      authenticated = true;

      // Read back what was actually granted (may be narrower than requested).
      const tokenInfo = await session.getTokenInfo(false);

### 9. `src/lib/components/ScopeGate.svelte` (new)

A reusable gate that renders its children only when the required tier is
granted, otherwise shows a "grant permissions" prompt.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { auth, requestScopeExpansion } from "$lib/auth.svelte";
  import type { ScopeSetName } from "$lib/scopes";

  let { tier, title, description, children }: {
    tier: ScopeSetName;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    children: import("svelte").Snippet;
  } = $props();

  let expanding = $state(false);

  async function expand() {
    expanding = true;
    try {
      await requestScopeExpansion(tier);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("Scope expansion failed:", err);
    } finally {
      expanding = false;
    }
  }
</script>

{#if auth.hasScope(tier)}
  {@render children()}
{:else}
  <div class="scope-gate">
    <h2>{title}</h2>
    <p>{description}</p>
    <button onclick={expand} disabled={expanding}>
      {expanding ? "Redirecting…" : "Grant permission"}
    </button>
  </div>
{/if}
```

Usage:

```svelte
<ScopeGate
  tier="semble"
  title="Your Semble collection"
  description="Roomy needs permission to add cards to your personal Semble collection."
>
  <PersonalSembleCollection />
</ScopeGate>
```

### 10. `static/oauth-client-metadata.json` (new, production only)

The `scope` field is the **union ceiling** (`FULL_SCOPE_CEILING`). This is what
allows app-lite to later request tiers beyond `base` without the PDS rejecting
them.

```json
{
  "client_id": "https://app.roomy.chat/oauth/client-metadata.json",
  "client_name": "Roomy",
  "client_uri": "https://roomy.chat",
  "redirect_uris": ["https://app.roomy.chat/oauth/callback"],
  "response_types": ["code"],
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none",
  "application_type": "web",
  "scope": "<FULL_SCOPE_CEILING value here>",
  "dpop_bound_access_tokens": true
}
```

> The exact `client_id` and `redirect_uris` depend on deployment. The critical
> field for this feature is `scope` — it must contain every token from every
> tier. In production the file is **generated**, not committed:
> `scripts/build-prod.sh` writes it (plus `oauth-client-native.json`) from a
> `SCOPE` variable. Phase 2 re-points that variable at `FULL_SCOPE_CEILING`;
> until then the hand-maintained `SCOPE` is the ceiling and is a superset of
> `config.ts` by a build-time check.

---

## End-to-End Flows

### First login (new user)

```
1. User enters handle
2. login(handle) → getLoginScope(handle) → { scope: null }  ← no prior grant
3. signIn({ scope: SCOPE_SETS.base })                        ← base only
4. PDS consent: shows base permissions
5. User consents → callback → init()
6. getTokenInfo() → grantedScope = "atproto rpc:... (base scopes)"
7. recordScopeGrant({ scope: grantedScope })                 ← stored on server
```

### Re-login (returning user, previously expanded to semble)

```
1. User enters handle (new browser, cleared storage)
2. login(handle) → getLoginScope(handle)
     → { did: "...", scope: "atproto rpc:... repo:network.cosmik.card?action=create ..." }
3. reconcileScope(stored, base, ceiling)
     → scope = base ∪ stored (already a superset of base)
4. signIn({ scope: reconciled })                             ← full scope
5. PDS consent: no new permissions → issues token silently
6. callback → init()
7. getTokenInfo() → grantedScope = full scope
8. recordScopeGrant({ scope: grantedScope })                 ← refreshed
```

The user gets personal-Semble access back immediately, with no consent prompt.

### Scope expansion (existing user, first time saving to their Semble collection)

```
1. User invokes "save to my Semble collection"
2. auth.hasScope("semble") → false → consent dialogue names the capability
3. User accepts → requestScopeExpansion("semble")
     → sessionStorage.setItem(PENDING_EXPANSION_KEY, "semble")
     → signIn({ scope: SCOPE_SETS.semble })
4. PDS consent: shows only network.cosmik.* repo scopes (delta from grant)
5. User consents → callback → init()
6. getTokenInfo() → grantedScope = base + semble
7. recordScopeGrant({ scope: grantedScope })                 ← stored for next time
8. hasScopeSet(grantedScope, "semble") → true                ← gate opens
9. The pending action resumes and the card is written
```

### Scope error on a newly-shipped feature (existing session, no expansion)

```
1. User invokes an action whose scope shipped after their session was issued
2. The XRPC call fails with an insufficient-scope error
3. guardedXrpc catches it → consent dialogue for the required tier
4. Accept → step 3 of the expansion flow above; Reject → the call's error
   surfaces with a message that names the capability, and the app stays usable
```

### User narrowed consent on re-login

```
1. User re-logs in, unchecks the Semble scopes on the consent screen
2. getTokenInfo() → grantedScope = base only (no semble)
3. recordScopeGrant({ scope: grantedScope })                 ← narrowed record
4. hasScopeSet("semble") → false                             ← gate re-shows
```

On next re-login, `getLoginScope` returns the narrowed scope. The user is NOT
silently re-granted Semble. They must re-expand if they want it back. This
respects explicit user choice, and it is why the stored value is last-granted
and not a high-water mark (see Open Question 2).

---

## Scope Detection Strategies

Two complementary approaches for deciding *when* to trigger expansion:

### A. Proactive (feature-gate check)

Best when the app knows up-front that an action needs extra scopes (e.g. the
"save to my Semble collection" toolbar action):

```typescript
export async function saveToPersonalCollection(card: { url: string }) {
  if (!auth.hasScope("semble")) {
    // The consent dialogue handles the prompt and the redirect.
    const accepted = await showScopeConsentDialogue("semble");
    if (!accepted) return;
    await requestScopeExpansion("semble");
    return; // browser redirects away; flow resumes in init()
  }
  await saveToPersonalSembleCollection(card);
}
```

### B. Reactive (intercept insufficient-scope errors)

**In scope as a shipped path (Meri 2026-09-23), not a later fallback.** This is
the common case: a feature ships, users already hold a session without the new
scope, and the request fails with an error that tells them nothing useful. The
same dialogue that handles a deliberate expansion must handle this.

The PDS returns a 4xx whose shape depends on the layer — `invalid_scope` from
the authorization server, `insufficient_scope` from the resource server — and
the exact shape must be **confirmed against a live PDS and recorded**, not
guessed (Phase 5, step 1). The predicate below is the placeholder:

```typescript
function isInsufficientScopeError(err: unknown): boolean {
  // @atproto errors carry an `error` field; CONFIRM the real shape in Phase 5
  // and replace this comment with the measured values.
  return Boolean(
    err && typeof err === "object" &&
    "error" in err &&
    ((err as any).error === "invalid_scope" ||
     (err as any).error === "insufficient_scope")
  );
}

/**
 * Run an XRPC call; on an insufficient-scope failure, surface the consent
 * dialogue for `requiredTier` instead of the raw error. Accepting navigates
 * away to the PDS; rejecting leaves the action failed and the UI intact.
 */
async function guardedXrpc<T>(
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
  requiredTier?: ScopeSetName,
): Promise<T> {
  try {
    return await fn();
  } catch (err) {
    if (requiredTier && isInsufficientScopeError(err)) {
      const accepted = await showScopeConsentDialogue(requiredTier);
      if (!accepted) throw err; // user declined — fail cleanly
      await requestScopeExpansion(requiredTier);
      // Unreachable in practice: the browser has navigated to the PDS.
    }
    throw err;
  }
}
```

The dialogue is a component (not an `alert`) that names the capability and
consequence — "Roomy needs permission to add cards to your personal Semble
collection" — with accept/reject. Meri's requirement is that it is *friendly*:
it explains the action, not the scope token.

---

## Edge Cases & Considerations

### Progressive scope edge cases

- **User denies the expansion.** `init()` checks `hasScopeSet()` after the
  redirect and logs a warning. The `ScopeGate` re-renders showing the prompt
  again. The feature stays gated until the user consents.

- **User narrows consent.** The PDS lets users uncheck scopes on the consent
  screen. `getTokenInfo().scope` reflects this. `hasScope()` correctly reports
  `false` if the user unchecked a needed scope — the gate re-shows the prompt.

- **Loopback client (dev) scope churn.** Each tier has a different `client_id`
  (scope is in the query param). Re-authorizing with `semble` creates a new
  client; the old `base` session is abandoned in IndexedDB. Acceptable for dev.
  Consider running `session.signOut()` on the old session before expansion to
  avoid stale entries.

- **`login_hint` reuse.** `sdkLogin(handle, ...)` passes the handle through
  `authorize()` as `login_hint`, so the PDS pre-fills the account and skips
  re-entry — the user only sees the consent delta, not a full sign-in.

- **Existing sessions in production.** Users who logged in before this change
  have a `base` grant. The metadata's new union ceiling does not retroactively
  grant them Semble — they still need to expand via the consent dialogue. This
  is correct, expected, and is exactly the case Meri named, so it is the case
  Phase 5's reactive path is built for.

- **Revoke in the settings UI (Phase 4).** Removing a tier from the stored
  grant does not remove it from a live token — the PDS has no such endpoint.
  The UI must say the change applies at next login rather than implying
  immediate revocation (Open Question 4).

- **Loopback vs public ceiling (unchanged).** The union ceiling can get long.
  For the loopback client, long `client_id` query strings may hit URL limits;
  the public client (production) uses a URL-based `client_id` with no such
  limit. Dev loopback should stay on `base` only.

### Server-side tracking edge cases

- **Stored scope contains removed scopes.** A future release removes a scope
  from a tier (e.g. a Semble action scope the UI no longer offers). A returning
  user's stored scope still contains it. If the client requests it, the PDS
  rejects with `invalid_scope` (not in the client metadata ceiling). **Fix:**
  `reconcileScope()` intersects the stored scope with `FULL_SCOPE_CEILING`
  before requesting. Removed scopes are silently dropped.

- **Stored scope is a strict subset of base.** Possible if a user logged in
  with an older, more minimal `base` definition. `reconcileScope()` unions
  with current `base`, so they always get at least base. The PDS may prompt for
  new base scopes not in the old grant.

- **Appserver loses the readstate DB.** If lost, all stored scopes are gone.
  Users fall back to `base` on next login and re-expand as needed. Graceful
  degradation — no corruption, just a minor UX regression (one extra consent
  prompt for previously-expanded users). **Mitigation:** include the readstate
  DB in the appserver's backup strategy (separate from the materialisation DB,
  which is disposable).

- **Multiple devices / browsers.** The scope grant is per-`user_did`, not
  per-device. Expansion on one device propagates to all on next login. This is
  the desired "max access they have already approved" behavior.

- **Race condition: concurrent logins.** Two tabs logging in simultaneously
  with the same handle both call `getLoginScope` (same stored scope), both
  request it, both callbacks call `recordScopeGrant`. Last write wins. No
  corruption — both write the same (or very similar) scope.

- **`recordScopeGrant` failure.** Non-fatal. The client has its session
  regardless. The server just won't remember the grant for next time. It
  self-heals within one login cycle.

---

## Rollout Phases

Server-side scope tracking lands first, as groundwork: it provides the
infrastructure (new endpoints, readstate table, scope reconciliation) that
every later tier builds on. Even with only a `base` tier, it makes re-login
return the user's previously-approved scope.

### Dispatch model (Meri 2026-09-23)

Each phase is one task, dispatched to one worker **as soon as the previous
phase is implemented** — not all at once. Meri: "create a plan for this task
that splits it into several phases and then dispatch an agent for each phase as
soon as the previous step is implemented. We can use stacked PRs if that's
available."

**Stacked PRs:** yes, available and the intended shape. Phase N branches from
phase N−1's branch (not from `next`), so a reviewer sees only that phase's
diff, and the stack rebases and merges bottom-up. Concretely:

```
next
 └── feat/progressive-scope-p1        (appserver groundwork)
      └── feat/progressive-scope-p2   (client scope refactor)
           └── feat/progressive-scope-p3 (grant tracking + settings UI)
                └── feat/progressive-scope-p4 (metadata ceiling)
                     └── feat/progressive-scope-p5 (Semble tier)
```

Each task's brief states its base branch explicitly, and a phase that finds its
parent changed must rebase onto the parent head before opening its PR. A phase
is dispatchable only once its parent has a **merged-or-open-but-green** PR;
the coordinator verifies the parent head is present before dispatching.

### Phase 1 — Server-side scope storage (groundwork)

1. Add `user_oauth_grants` table to `readStateSchema.sql`, bump
   `READSTATE_SCHEMA_VERSION`.
2. Implement `getLoginScope` handler: resolve handle→DID, query stored scope.
   Unauthenticated; rate-limited.
3. Implement `recordScopeGrant` handler: upsert scope for authenticated DID.
4. Register routes in `index.ts`.
5. Generate lexicon JSON files for both endpoints.

### Phase 2 — Client scope refactor (no behavior change)

1. Extract `OAUTH_SCOPE` into `scopes.ts` with a single `base` tier.
2. Add `reconcileScope()`, `parseScopes()`, `hasScopeSet()` helpers.
3. Add the two new appserver RPCs to `APPSERVER_RPCS` (so their `rpc:` scopes
   are in `base`).
4. **Move the ceiling's source of truth.** Today the ceiling is *not* generated
   from `config.ts`: `packages/app-lite/scripts/build-prod.sh` hand-maintains a
   `SCOPE` variable (~80 lines of `SCOPE+=" rpc:...?aud=*"`) and then verifies
   that `config.ts`'s `APPSERVER_RPCS`/`OAUTH_SCOPE` entries are a subset of it
   (`build-prod.sh:168-215`). That direction is correct for a single static
   scope and cannot express a union ceiling. `scopes.ts` becomes the single
   source, and the script derives `SCOPE` from `FULL_SCOPE_CEILING` (imported or
   extracted the same way it reads `config.ts` today) while the build check is
   re-pointed at the **ceiling ⊇ every tier's scopes**. Do this in Phase 2 so
   the refactor is behaviour-preserving: the generated string must be
   byte-identical to today's `SCOPE` before the ceiling grows in Phase 4.
5. Verify login/init still work identically. No metadata changes yet.

### Phase 3 — Client-side grant tracking + server sync

1. Add `grantedScope` state + `hasScope()` getter to `auth.svelte.ts`.
2. Call `getTokenInfo()` in `init()`, store the result.
3. Call `recordScopeGrant()` in `init()` after `getTokenInfo()` (fire-and-forget).
4. Add `pxUnauth()` to `client.ts` for unauthenticated XRPC calls.
5. Modify `login()` to call `getLoginScope` and use `reconcileScope()` result.
6. Land the `ScopeGate` component (unused, ready).
7. Still only `base` tier exists — but re-login now uses stored scope.

### Phase 4 — Public client metadata ceiling + user-editable access settings

Two halves, and the second is a Meri 2026-09-23 addition.

1. Grow the ceiling: `SCOPE` now derives from `FULL_SCOPE_CEILING` and includes
   every tier's scopes (`semble`; `withDms` too, since it is defined), while
   first-login still requests only `base`. Verify `base` login still works
   against the wider metadata.
2. **User-facing access settings** (Meri: "store users' PDS access settings in
   the app server and make them editable in their user account settings"):
   a. A new authenticated query (e.g. `space.roomy.auth.getScopeSettings`)
      returns, per grantable tier, whether the user's stored grant covers it,
      plus the raw stored scope for display.
   b. A procedure (e.g. `space.roomy.auth.setScopeSettings`) lets the user
      **request** a tier change. It cannot grant anything by itself — granting
      requires the PDS consent round-trip — so it records *intent*, and the
      client drives `requestScopeExpansion()`; the stored grant is updated only
      after `getTokenInfo()` confirms what the PDS actually returned.
   c. A settings page (user account settings, alongside the existing
      `routes/user/settings/*`) listing each capability group with its current
      state and an enable/revoke action.
   d. Revoking is honest: the user can narrow the stored grant so the next
      login requests less, but the live token keeps its scopes until the next
      re-auth — the UI must say so rather than implying immediate revocation.

### Phase 5 — Reactive consent dialogue for newly-shipped features

Meri 2026-09-23: a feature shipped to users who already have a session hits a
scope error that "is not particularly friendly"; handle it the same way as
progressive expansion.

1. Promote strategy B (`guardedXrpc` + `isInsufficientScopeError`) from
   "later fallback" to a shipped path — confirm the actual PDS error shape
   against a live PDS first and record it in the plan's Open Questions as an
   answered fact.
2. A dialogue that names the required capability, its consequence, and the
   scopes, with accept/reject. Accept → `requestScopeExpansion(tier)` (the
   browser navigates away; the pending action resumes after the callback).
   Reject → the action fails cleanly with a message, and the UI stays usable.
3. Wire it at the boundaries of features whose scopes are outside `base`.

### Phase 6 — First extension (`semble`)

Meri 2026-09-23: the first tier is Semble, not DMs, because the space-collection
half already exists in-tree and the personal half does not — "it can serve as a
good test case for progressive scope expansion."

**What exists today** (verified on `origin/next` `2d5051dc`):
`sdk/src/atproto/cosmik-card.ts` `createCosmikCard` writes
`network.cosmik.card` via the arbiter's `space.roomy.authComplete.arbiter.proxy`
against a **space's** stewarded repo, and the published
`space.roomy.authComplete` scope policy admits proxied `network.cosmik.*`
writes. app-lite wires it from the message toolbar
(`mutations/space-card.ts`, commit `e1aff94b`). **Nothing writes to a user's
own PDS, and no `network.cosmik.*` repo scope appears anywhere in `OAUTH_SCOPE`
or the client metadata.**

1. Add the personal-collection scopes (`repo:network.cosmik.card?action=create`,
   and whatever `update`/`delete` the UI needs) to the metadata ceiling as a
   new `semble` tier — deliberately NOT in `base`, so it is the first
   capability a user meets through the consent dialogue.
2. Add a "save to my Semble collection" action that writes
   `network.cosmik.card` to the **user's** repo (direct `putRecord`/
   `createRecord`, not the arbiter proxy), gated on the `semble` tier.
3. Verify end-to-end: first attempt → dialogue → accept → consent round-trip →
   the card lands in the user's collection → re-login returns the wider scope
   with no prompt.

**Ordering note for the dispatcher:** phases 1–3 are strictly sequential (each
consumes the previous phase's API). Phase 4 depends on 3. Phase 5 depends on 3
and 4 (it reuses the settings/procedure plumbing and the ceiling). Phase 6
depends only on 2 and 5 — it adds a tier and the dialogue is what makes the
tier reachable, so it can run in parallel with 4 once 3 has landed.

---

## Open Questions

1. **Should `getLoginScope` also return the tier name** so the client can
   pre-select UI state? **Recommendation:** no — derive the tier from the scope
   string via `hasScopeSet`. The server should not know client-side tier names.
   (Meri 2026-09-23's settings UI does not change this: the settings page is a
   client-side mapping from tier → capability label, and it renders the raw
   stored scope for the user to see.)

2. **Should we store a high-water mark (max ever approved) or last-granted
   (most recent consent)?** This design uses last-granted, which respects
   narrowing. **Now load-bearing, not optional:** the Phase 4 settings UI lets a
   user revoke, and a high-water mark would silently re-grant on next login —
   the exact opposite of what the revoke control promises. Keep last-granted.
   If a "you once had this" hint is wanted later, add a separate
   `max_approved_scope` column for display only.

3. **What is the actual PDS error shape for an insufficient scope?**
   **UNANSWERED — Phase 5 step 1 must measure it** against a live PDS and
   replace the placeholder predicate in §Scope Detection Strategies B. Both
   `invalid_scope` (authorization server) and `insufficient_scope` (resource
   server) appear in the spec; guessing which one a given failure surfaces as is
   the defect this question exists to prevent.

4. **Revocation semantics for the settings UI.** A user who revokes a tier
   cannot have it removed from a live token; the PDS has no such endpoint. So
   the honest behaviour is: narrow the *stored* grant, tell the user the change
   takes effect at next login, and (optionally) offer "sign out and back in to
   apply now". **Recommendation:** ship the honest version — do not imply
   immediate revocation.

5. **Rate limiting for `getLoginScope`.** The endpoint does handle→DID
   resolution, which hits the PLC directory / DNS, so it should be rate-limited
   per IP. The existing `rateLimit.ts` applies. **Recommendation:** match the
   login-attempt rate; if that is currently unbounded, treat it as a separate
   finding rather than a reason to leave this endpoint open.

6. **`pxUnauth()` implementation.** The exact `DirectXrpcClient` API may need
   adjustment to support a no-auth mode. The requirement is narrow: call
   `getLoginScope` without a Bearer token. Confirm against the real constructor
   in Phase 3.
