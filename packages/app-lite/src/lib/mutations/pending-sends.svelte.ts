/**
 * Delivery state for messages this client has sent but the appserver has not
 * acknowledged yet.
 *
 * A send is optimistic: `sendMessage` builds the event with a client-generated
 * ULID, writes a message-shaped placeholder under the room's `getMessages`
 * cache key, and only then calls `sendEvents`. Because the appserver keys the
 * `#messageDiff` `add` op by that same ULID, the server row *replaces* the
 * placeholder when it arrives — reconciliation is by construction, not a merge
 * step (see `applyMessageDiff`: `map.set(op.key, op.message)`).
 *
 * Delivery state lives here rather than on the cached `Message` so the cache
 * keeps holding server-shaped rows: the diff `add` swaps the entry wholesale
 * (dropping any flag we had attached to it) and an `update` op spreads over it
 * (which would strand a stale flag). Renderers read this registry by id.
 *
 * On failure the placeholder stays in the timeline marked `failed` and the
 * event is retained, so a retry resends the identical payload — same ULID,
 * hence the same reconciliation. Nothing here survives a reload: this is
 * in-place optimistic UI, not an outbox.
