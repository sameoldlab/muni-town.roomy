/**
 * Regression tests for shareable-link origins.
 *
 * The bug: invite links were built from `location.origin`, which in the Tauri
 * desktop app is `tauri://localhost` — links copied out of the desktop invite
 * modal could not be opened by anyone else. These tests pin the rule that
 * replaces it: links are rooted at the public web origin unless the document
 * *is* the public web deployment.
 *
 * Written against `node:test` + `node:assert` (available without adding a
 * dependency to app-lite; app-lite ships no test runner of its own) so the file
 * runs under both `bun test` and `node --test --experimental-strip-types`.
