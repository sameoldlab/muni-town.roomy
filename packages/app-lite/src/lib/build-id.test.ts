/**
 * The build-identity rule: a bundle must be able to name its commit, and a
 * build with no git metadata must say `unknown` rather than something
 * present-but-empty (which no consumer downstream can tell from a real id).
 *
 * Written against `node:test` + `node:assert` (available without adding a
 * dependency to app-lite; app-lite ships no test runner of its own) so the
 * file runs under both `bun test` and `node --test --experimental-strip-types`.
