/**
 * The "Previously signed in as" record (`localStorage["last-login"]`).
 *
 * This record is the only client-side memory of a signed-out identity, and it
 * is what the login screen offers as a one-click sign-in. It is written by
 * `updateProfile()` on a successful profile fetch and read by `LoginModal`
 * and `SidebarUserCard`.
 *
 * **Why this module exists.** The stored `handle` is a *snapshot* taken at
 * profile-fetch time, but handles are mutable: a user can rename, or lose the
 * domain their handle lives on. The record outlives the handle it names, and
 * nothing ever re-checked it — so the login screen could offer a handle that
 * no longer resolves, and clicking it failed in identity resolution
 * ("Failed to resolve identity: <handle>"). Keeping a snapshot forever is what
 * caused that, so the record is no longer trusted on its own:
 *
 * - `did` is the durable identity; the handle is treated as a cache of it.
 * - Before a record is offered, its handle is re-checked against the DID it was
 *   stored with (via the public Bluesky appview — unauthenticated and
 *   CORS-enabled, and already the handle source used by `HandleTypeahead` and
 *   by the appserver's own profile fallback).
 * - A handle that no longer matches the DID is repaired from the DID's current
 *   handle; a DID with no usable handle drops the record entirely.
 *
 * The check fails *closed*: when the appview cannot be reached the record is
 * withheld (a handle we cannot verify is exactly what produced the reported
 * error) but not deleted, so a later successful check can offer it again. The
 * user can still type their handle in the meantime.
 *
 * The record is deliberately **not** cleared on logout: it exists precisely to
 * offer a signed-out user their previous identity, so clearing it at logout
 * would delete the feature rather than fix it.
 *
 * The logic here is storage- and network-injected so it is testable without a
 * DOM; the reactive wrapper lives in `last-login.svelte.ts`.
