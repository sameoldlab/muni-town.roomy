/**
 * Reactive binding for the "Previously signed in as" record.
 *
 * All decision logic lives in `last-login.ts` (storage- and network-injected,
 * unit-tested); this module only holds the `$state` the UI renders from and
 * exposes the mutators the app calls.
 *
 * `current` is seeded *only* by verification, never from storage directly: a
 * snapshot offered during the verification round-trip would still let a click
 * reach the PDS with a dead handle — the bug this feature exists to fix.
