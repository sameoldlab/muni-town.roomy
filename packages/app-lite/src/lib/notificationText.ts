/**
 * Visible notification text for a decrypted web-push payload.
 *
 * Extracted out of the service worker so the render contract is testable:
 * the app-lite service worker imports this and feeds it decrypted payloads
 * (see `service-worker.ts`), and `packages/appserver/src/push/notificationText.test.ts`
 * exercises it with synthetic payloads. The payload shape mirrors
 * `packages/appserver/src/push/types.ts` — the server guarantees `authorDid`
 * on every push it builds, and `authorName` whenever the author is known.
 *
 * The author is the headline: `authorName` when the server resolved one,
 * else the raw `authorDid`. A notification must name its sender — "New
 * message" is only for the (now unreachable in practice) case where the
 * payload carries no author at all.
