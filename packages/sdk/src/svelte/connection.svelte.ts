 * (e.g. when the connection is created inside an `$effect` and stored in
 * a `$state` variable). When the connection changes, its subscription is
 * torn down and a new one is established automatically.
 *
 * Uses a structural interface (`SyncConnectionLike`) rather than the
 * concrete `SyncConnection` class so that consumers importing from
 * different resolution paths (dist vs source) don't hit nominal-type
 * mismatches from private fields.
