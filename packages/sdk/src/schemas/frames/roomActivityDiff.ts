/**
 * Schema for the `#roomActivityDiff` WS frame body.
 * Sent server → client over `space.roomy.sync.subscribe`, one frame per
 * subscribed connection (a broadcast — the fields are identical for every
 * reader, unlike `#roomMetadataDiff` which is sent per affected user).
 *
 * Source of truth: packages/appserver/src/sync/handler.ts
 * (#routeRoomActivityDiff) and packages/appserver/src/invalidation/types.ts
 * (RoomActivityDiff signal).
 *
 * Header is `{ op: 1, t: "#roomActivityDiff" }` — encoded separately as the
 * first CBOR value of the frame.
 *
 * A message just landed in `roomId` and is now that room's latest activity, so
 * the activity-ordered views move: the boards (`space.roomy.space.getThreads`,
 * `space.roomy.room.getThreads`) and `room.getMetadata.recentThreads`. The
 * client upserts this row and moves it to the front, instead of refetching
 * each board per message.
 *
 * The frame carries no caller-scoped field: unread counts ride on
 * `#roomMetadataDiff`, which knows the per-user delta.
