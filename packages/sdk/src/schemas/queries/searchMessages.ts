/**
 * Schema for `space.roomy.search.messages` (query).
 *
 * Full-text message search backed by Qdrant, filtered by the caller's read
 * access. Scope precedence: `roomId` narrows the search to one room (a
 * channel plus its threads, or a thread plus its parent channel), `spaceId`
 * narrows it to one space, and with neither the search spans every space
 * the caller has joined (cross-space). A `spaceId` supplied alongside a
 * `roomId` must be the room's owning space. Returns messages hydrated via
 * selectMessages so the response shape matches the shared Message schema,
 * plus `roomId`/`spaceId` so results can be linked back to their source
 * room, and the resolved display names (`spaceName`/`spaceAvatar`/
 * `roomName`/`roomKind`) so the result context line renders without extra
 * summary queries. Each hit carries a denormalised `reply` (the replied-to
 * message, fully hydrated) when it is resolvable and the caller may read
 * its room — search results render in a chat-style list, so the preview
 * rides along instead of costing the client a getMessage fetch per hit.
