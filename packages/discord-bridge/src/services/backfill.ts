/**
 * Phase 1: the bounded recent window for one (channel, space) pair.
 *
 * Pages the channel newest-first via `before`-pagination and ingests up to
 * PHASE1_MESSAGE_BOUND messages — the most recent ones — so the space is
 * immediately usable. Ends when the page returns fewer than
 * PHASE1_PAGE_SIZE messages (the whole history fit → pair is `complete` on
 * the spot) or when the bound is reached (→ `phase2` with `windowBoundary`
 * set to the oldest message ingested; the Phase-2 walk covers everything
 * strictly below it).
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - Falsifiable bound: this function ingests at most PHASE1_MESSAGE_BOUND
 *   messages per (channel, space).
 * - Advance-on-success-only / stall guard (mirrors the walk): `before` only
 *   moves after a successful page, and a page that fails to be strictly
 *   older than the previous `before` stops the window instead of looping.
 * - The caller holds this pair's guard in `activeBackfills` (or has verified
 *   no other backfill is running for it).
 *
 * `channel_cursors.last_message_id` is written monotonically (never
 * regressed): the live path updates it with each live message, and the walk
 * only ever pushes it up.

/**
 * Post the Discord-side "backfill complete" system message for
 * every bridged space that the current run actually did work for.
 *
 * Completion point: the NOTICE fires only after ALL phases are done — every
 * bridged channel, every active thread, and the deprioritized archived-thread
 * sweep — so "complete" means the entire history of the server is synced, not
 * just the Phase-1 windows. Archived threads are included rather than
 * excluded, because the bridge treats them as part of the space's history and
 * the Roomy-side notice would otherwise under-report on servers with
 * archived threads.
 *
 * Destination channel (first match wins):
 *  1. BACKFILL_NOTICE_CHANNEL env override, if it names a reachable
 *     top-level channel;
 *  2. the guild's first announcement channel (type GUILD_ANNOUNCEMENT) — the
 *     conventional place for server-wide status messages;
 *  3. the first bridged top-level text channel of the guild.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: a missing guild, unreachable channel, or failed
 * send is logged and skips — it never throws, and never fails the backfill
 * run itself.
