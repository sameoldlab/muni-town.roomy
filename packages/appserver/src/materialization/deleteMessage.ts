/**
 * Derived-state side-effects for `space.roomy.message.deleteMessage.v0`.
 *
 * The SDK materialiser only deletes the entity rows (the message, and any
 * forward references to it). That is enough for room-scoped READS, but a delete
 * must also unwind the derived state `createMessage` built, or the appserver
 * keeps serving the deleted message from paths it no longer appears in:
 *
 *   - `activity_item` → the deleted message stays in the room's
 *     `recent_message_ids` window and keeps being rendered by the activity feed
 *     until the window happens to roll. A room whose messages are ALL deleted
 *     keeps listing as an activity item with a stale message list (or none).
 *   - read-state (unread) → the message is still counted in every reader's
 *     `unread_count`, so deleting unread messages leaves an unread badge that
 *     can never be cleared.
 *
 * Both are the exact mirror of `applyMoveSideEffects`'s source-room unwind, so
 * they reuse its helpers (`rebuildActivityWindow`,
 * `decrementUnreadForRemovedMessages`) — one implementation, so the move path
 * and the delete path cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Read-state is live-only, as it is for moves: the boot recovery migration
 * re-derives membership, not unread counts, so replaying an old delete over a
 * newer read-state would corrupt the counts.
