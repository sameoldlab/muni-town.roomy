 *   - `rebuildActivityWindow` — recompute `activity_item.recent_message_ids`
 *     from the room's newest message-shaped rows, deleting the row when the
 *     room is empty so the activity feed stops listing a gutted room.
 *   - `decrementUnreadForRemovedMessages` — remove exactly the unread messages
 *     a user still owed when messages leave the room, never below zero.
 *
 * `moveMessages` (source room) and `deleteMessage` both need them, so they live
 * here rather than in either caller: a second copy is how the two paths drift.

/**
 * Remove messages from every reader's unread count — exact, not a blind `-1`.
 *
 * A user's `unread_count` for a room counts the messages past their
 * `seen_up_to` watermark (createMessage adds one per message). Removing a
 * message must subtract only the messages that were still unread for that
 * user, and the watermark decides it: `originalSortIndexes` are the ordering
 * keys the messages held while they were in the room, and `seen_up_to` is
 * also a stored `sort_idx`, so comparing the two says whether each was unread.
 *
 * Blindly subtracting one per message would corrupt the count for users who
 * had already read them — the count is maintained incrementally, so this is
 * the only place with enough information to be exact.
 *
 * Callers pass the ordering key they can vouch for: a move reconstructs it
 * from `comp_content.timestamp` (the message's `sort_idx` has already been
 * rewritten by then), a delete passes the `sort_idx` it read before the row
 * was removed.
