/**
 * Set `entities.sort_idx` for messages moved by a `moveMessages` event.
 *
 * Ordering policy — a moved message sorts at the TOP of the destination
 * room's timeline, keyed by the MOVE event's own ULID time.
 *
 * Why: `sort_idx` is the server's page-selection key (`selectMessages` orders
 * by it and takes the newest `limit` rows — room.getMessages.ts). A moved
 * message that kept its original `sort_idx` would be buried according to its
 * ORIGINAL send time, so moving an old message into a busy channel would put
 * it outside the newest-50 page: it would flash into connected clients via
 * the WS `add` diff and vanish on the next refetch. Keying by the move
 * event's time makes the move immediately visible and consistent between the
 * diff and a refetch, which is the same reasoning the `forwardMessages` fix
 * above applies to a forward of an old message.
 *
 * `comp_content.timestamp` is deliberately NOT rewritten: the message's
 * original send time is its identity, and the client renders timestamps from
 * `timestamp` (the timeline is ordered by cache order, which the diff
 * re-sorts by `timestamp` — see the SDK's `applyMessageDiff`).
 *
 * Only messages that actually exist are touched (a move of an unmaterialised
 * id is a no-op), and the update is unconditional: unlike create/forward,
 * which use `and sort_idx is null`, a moved message already HAS a sort_idx
 * and the move must overwrite it.
