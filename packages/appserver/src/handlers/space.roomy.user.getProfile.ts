/**
 * XRPC: space.roomy.user.getProfile (query).
 *
 * Returns a user's profile. The `actor` param accepts a DID or handle;
 * handles are resolved to DIDs via the PLC directory.
 *
 * **Read-after-write consistency:** The appserver processes events from its
 * local event store, not ATProto repo commits, so a `putRecord` to
 * `space.roomy.user.profile/self` on the PDS does not trigger
 * re-materialisation. To stay fresh, this handler always checks HappyView
 * (which indexes the Jetstream firehose and caches Roomy profile records
 * locally) and re-materialises from it when a record exists.
 *
 * When no Roomy record exists in HappyView, it falls back to the
 * materialised `comp_info` row, then to on-demand Bluesky hydration.
 *
 * Profile fields (handle, displayName, etc.) may be absent when the user
 * has no Roomy profile record and no Bluesky profile — that's expected and
 * not an error. Only `did` is always present.
