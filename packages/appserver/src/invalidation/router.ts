/**
 * InvalidationRouter: typed pub/sub bus for invalidation signals.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   1. Create a singleton router.
 *   2. Pass it to SpaceMaterializer (which calls `onEventsApplied` after
 *      each batch).
 *   3. Consumers (WS handler, server cache) call `subscribe`.
 *
 * The router is synchronous — `onEventsApplied` collects signals and
 * dispatches them to listeners inline. This keeps the overhead per event
 * minimal (pure function call + array push) and avoids any async scheduling
 * complexity. Listeners that need async work (WS send, cache I/O) should
 * enqueue and process on their own microtask queue.
