/**
 * Types for the invalidation system.
 *
 * An InvalidationSignal is emitted whenever an event changes data that
 * one or more XRPC query endpoints depend on. Signals are consumed by:
 *
 *   1. The WS sync handler → #invalidate / #messageDiff frames to clients
 *   2. The server-side response cache → evict stale entries
 *   3. (future) Notification router → push alerts
 *
 * The mapping from event → signals is pure and stateless (lives in
 * `inferSignals`). The `InvalidationRouter` wraps it in a typed pub/sub bus.
