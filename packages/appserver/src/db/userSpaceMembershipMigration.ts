/**
 * One-time recovery of durable user-space membership intent from the event log.
 *
 * The v6 global repair derived active memberships from per-space `member`
 * edges, which resurrected spaces users had left (leaving persists the
 * `member` edge and only records `leftSpace` in the global DB). This migration
 * instead reduces the full join/leave history — both current
 * `space.roomy.space.*` and deprecated `space.roomy.space.personal.*` events —
 * ordered by event ULID per (user, space), and writes the winner into the
 * read-state `user_space_membership` table.
 *
 * Runs as a resumable read-state migration: the worker inserts a
 * `readstate_schema_migrations` row with `completed_at = null`; startup runs
 * this task and stamps completion only after full success. Interrupted runs
 * retry next boot. Idempotent.
