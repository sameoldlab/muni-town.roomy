/**
 * SQLite handles for the appserver.
 *
 * Phase 4 (worker pool): the per-space DBs run on a pool of N `Bun.Worker`
 * threads, hash-routed by `spaceDid` (`hash(spaceDid) % N`), so different
 * spaces' materialization and reads run on different threads in parallel.
 * Dedicated workers each own one of the shared DBs: a "global" worker, a
 * "readstate" worker and an "events" worker. There is no monolithic
 * materialised DB — the per-space DBs are the source of truth for space data
 * (Phase 3 of docs/plans/per-space-dbs.md).
 *
 * This module owns the shared `DatabasePool` and hands out routed handles:
 * `openDb()` → the router (event-log DB by default, with `forSpace`/`global`/
 * `readState`/`events`/`backfillEntitySpace` dispatch), `openSpaceDb(spaceDid)`
 * → per-space DB, `openGlobalDb()` → global DB, `openReadStateDb()` →
 * read-state DB, `openEventsDb()` → event-log DB.

 *
 * `.3`: added the global `entity_space` entity→space index (Phase 3),
 * replacing the monolithic DB's `entities.stream_id` lookup for
 * `openSpaceDbForEntity`.
 *
 * `.4`: added the global `pending_links` embed-sweeper index (Phase 3),
 * dual-written during materialization so the sweeper can find pending
 * embed links across all per-space DBs with one query.
 *
 * `.5`: added the global `mentions` index (mentions subscription) — one row
 * per (mentioned DID, message), dual-written during materialization so the
 * `mentions:<did>` sync topic can backfill via getMentions and deleteMessage
 * can resolve a deleted message's mentioned DIDs.
 *
 * `.6`: added resumable global post-migration tracking and schedules a
 * one-time repair of active joined-space edges from per-space membership
 * truth. This recovers global DBs wiped by the v4→v5 deployment bug.
