 *
 * Materialisation is fully deterministic from the local event log, so on a
 * schema-version mismatch the file is automatically deleted and re-created.
 *
 * The actual SQLite operations run in a Bun.Worker thread. This module
 * provides an AsyncDatabase proxy that communicates with the worker via
 * message-passing.

/**
 * Bump whenever schema.sql OR materialiser logic changes — a bump triggers
 * a wipe + full re-materialisation from the local event log, which is how a
 * materialiser change is rolled out to existing data. Mirrors the frontend's
 * `CONFIG.databaseSchemaVersion`. Strings, not numbers, so we can use
 * suffixes (e.g. `"6-appserver.1"`) once the two diverge.
 *
 * `.7`: getSpaces/hydration now read membership from `joinedSpace` edges
 * instead of `comp_space.hidden`; needs a re-materialise to seed the edges.
 *
 * `.10`: fixed missing ORDER BY in module "events" and "metadata" subscription
 * queries — without it, backfill pagination skips events. The old DB has
 * holes; a wipe forces clean re-materialisation with the fixed module.
 *
 * `.11`: added `comp_embed_link_data` table for caching enriched embed
 * metadata from the external embed service.
 *
 * `.10-appserver.3`: embed retry-with-backoff. `comp_embed_link_data`
 * gains `attempts` (consecutive transient-failure count) and `retry_after`
 * (epoch ms; transient failures re-queue after this backoff). The pending
 * query now also returns retry-eligible rows, so links stuck on a null row
 * from a transient failure (service down / timeout / 5xx) get re-tried
 * with exponential backoff instead of being permanently abandoned.
 * Definitive failures (404 / no-data) settle with no retry. Wipe re-derives
 * embed data from scratch.
 *
 * `.10-appserver.2`: SDK `createRoomLink` materialiser made idempotent
 * (`on conflict do nothing`) — re-applying the same link event no longer
 * flips `canonical_parent` 1 → 0, which corrupted parent-channel links for
 * threads on streams that got re-backfilled. Wipe re-derives correct
 * canonical_parent values from the event log.
 *
 * `.10-appserver.5`: added `banner`, `pronouns`, `website` columns to
 * `comp_info` for the Roomy profile record (`space.roomy.user.profile`).
 * Wipe re-materialises profiles from the new Roomy-first fetcher (PDS
 * record with Bluesky fallback), populating the new columns.
 *
 * `.10-appserver.6`: fix display name regression — the Bluesky fallback
 * path was overwriting `comp_info.name` with the handle when
 * `displayName` was absent, clobbering names set by `SetUserProfile`
 * events (bridged users) and prior fetches. Wipe re-materialises with
 * the fixed insert strategy (Bluesky fallback uses `on conflict do
 * nothing`, never writes handle as name).
