/**
 * SQLite handles for the appserver's materialised views.
 *
 * One Bun.Worker owns ALL SQLite I/O process-wide: the monolithic
 * materialised DB (`data/roomy.sqlite`), the read-state DB, the event-log
 * DB, and — for the per-space split (Phase 1 of
 * docs/plans/per-space-dbs.md) — lazily-created per-space DBs
 * (`data/spaces/<spaceDid>.sqlite`) and a global DB (`data/global.sqlite`).
 *
 * The schema in `./schema.sql` mirrors the frontend worker schema so the
 * SDK's pure materializer functions can be reused unchanged.
 *
 * Materialisation is fully deterministic from the local event log, so on a
 * schema-version mismatch the file is automatically deleted and re-created.
 *
 * This module owns the shared WorkerLink and hands out routed handles:
 * `openDb()` → monolithic DB, `openSpaceDb(spaceDid)` → per-space DB,
 * `openGlobalDb()` → global DB. All are proxies over the same worker.

/**
 * Bump whenever schema.sql OR materialiser logic changes — a bump triggers
 * a wipe + full re-materialisation from the local event log, which is how a
 * materialiser change is rolled out to existing data. Mirrors the frontend's
 * `CONFIG.databaseSchemaVersion`. Strings, not numbers, so we can use
 * suffixes (e.g. `"6-appserver.1"`) once the two diverge.
 *
 * `.7`: getSpaces/hydration now read membership from `joinedSpace` edges
 * instead of `comp_space.hidden`; needs a re-materialise to seed the edges.
 *
 * `.10`: fixed missing ORDER BY in module "events" and "metadata" subscription
 * queries — without it, backfill pagination skips events. The old DB has
 * holes; a wipe forces clean re-materialisation with the fixed module.
 *
 * `.11`: added `comp_embed_link_data` table for caching enriched embed
 * metadata from the external embed service.
 *
 * `.10-appserver.3`: embed retry-with-backoff. `comp_embed_link_data`
 * gains `attempts` (consecutive transient-failure count) and `retry_after`
 * (epoch ms; transient failures re-queue after this backoff). The pending
 * query now also returns retry-eligible rows, so links stuck on a null row
 * from a transient failure (service down / timeout / 5xx) get re-tried
 * with exponential backoff instead of being permanently abandoned.
 * Definitive failures (404 / no-data) settle with no retry. Wipe re-derives
 * embed data from scratch.
 *
 * `.10-appserver.2`: SDK `createRoomLink` materialiser made idempotent
 * (`on conflict do nothing`) — re-applying the same link event no longer
 * flips `canonical_parent` 1 → 0, which corrupted parent-channel links for
 * threads on streams that got re-backfilled. Wipe re-derives correct
 * canonical_parent values from the event log.
 *
 * `.10-appserver.5`: added `banner`, `pronouns`, `website` columns to
 * `comp_info` for the Roomy profile record (`space.roomy.user.profile`).
 * Wipe re-materialises profiles from the new Roomy-first fetcher (PDS
 * record with Bluesky fallback), populating the new columns.
 *
 * `.10-appserver.6`: fix display name regression — the Bluesky fallback
 * path was overwriting `comp_info.name` with the handle when
 * `displayName` was absent, clobbering names set by `SetUserProfile`
 * events (bridged users) and prior fetches. Wipe re-materialises with
 * the fixed insert strategy (Bluesky fallback uses `on conflict do
 * nothing`, never writes handle as name).
 *
 * `.10-appserver.7`: SDK `UpdateSpaceInfo` materialiser now always ensures
 * a `comp_space` row (and the space's own `entities` row) exists, even when
 * the event carries only name/description (no space-level fields). Without
 * this, spaces created via `createDefaultSpaceEvents` (the default path)
 * never got a `comp_space` row from their own stream — they only got one
 * incidentally when a member's `JoinSpace` event materialised. After a
 * schema-version wipe, re-materialization from the event log failed to
 * recreate `comp_space` (FK constraint), so `getMetadata` returned 404 and
 * the frontend couldn't navigate to any space. Wipe re-derives the rows.
 *
 * `.10-appserver.8`: personal stream removal — `joinedSpace`/`leftSpace` edges
 * now use the user DID as `head` (not a personal-stream DID). The
 * `comp_user_personal_stream` table is dropped. Wipe re-materialises edges
 * from the updated `JoinSpace`/`LeaveSpace` materialisers
 * (which use `user` from the event context as the edge head).
 *
 * `.10-appserver.9`: re-run of `.8`'s re-materialisation with a corrected
 * SDK build. The `.8` wipe ran against a stale `@roomy-space/sdk` dist that
 * still wrote `joinedSpace` edges with the personal-stream DID as `head`,
 * so `getSpaces` returned nothing for users whose membership was rebuilt
 * from the event log. Rebuild the SDK, then wipe again so edges are written
 * with `head = userDid`.
 *
 * `.10-appserver.10`: forcing rematerialisation on prod due to aborted
 * materialisation error.
 *
 * Note: the per-space split (Phase 1) does NOT bump this version — the
 * monolithic DB's materialisation semantics are unchanged and its data is
 * already correct. Per-space DBs are derived from it via lazy backfill
 * (docs/plans/per-space-dbs.md §1h); a bump here would force an unnecessary
 * full re-materialisation of every space on first deploy.
