/**
 * Single source of truth for the read-state schema version and its migrations.
 *
 * The read-state DB (`data/roomy-readstate.sqlite`) is versioned by one number
 * and upgraded by two mechanisms:
 *
 *   1. `up` (worker thread) — structural DDL applied synchronously at worker
 *      init, before `handleInit` returns. Most versions need none:
 *      `readStateSchema.sql` is exec'd idempotently on every open, so a plain
 *      `create table if not exists` is already present on both fresh and
 *      existing DBs. Only an ALTER whose column is absent on a pre-vN DB needs
 *      an explicit `up` — declaring the column at the top level of the schema
 *      file would throw on that DB before the migration can run. (See the NOTE
 *      in `readStateSchema.sql` for the v7 instance of this.)
 *
 *   2. `runPendingReadStateMigrations` (main thread) — async data tasks that
 *      may scan the event log. Every `kind: "data"` version MUST register a
 *      task in `READSTATE_MIGRATION_TASKS` (userSpaceMembershipMigration.ts);
 *      a `kind: "structural"` version MUST NOT. Both directions are enforced
 *      by the compiler — `ReadStateAsyncVersion` below is derived from this
 *      manifest, and the task map is typed as `Record<ReadStateAsyncVersion,
 *      …>`, so a missing task and a task for a structural version are both
 *      type errors rather than a boot-time crash loop.
 *
 * This module is imported by BOTH the worker thread and the main thread, so it
 * MUST stay dependency-free: no `log.ts` (which pulls in OpenTelemetry), no
 * `db.ts`. Types and constants only.
 */
