/**
 * Roomy Pro members-area role grants, stored in the read-state DB.

 * The reconcile sweep (billing/proRoleReconcile.ts) adds paying Roomy Pro
 * subscribers to the 'Members' role in the Roomy Space and removes them
 * when their subscription lapses. This table tracks the DIDs the sweep
 * itself granted — it is the ownership record that lets the sweep remove a
 * lapsed subscriber WITHOUT ever clobbering a manually-assigned member who
 * is not (or no longer) a subscriber. Removal only applies to a tracked DID
 * whose subscription has lapsed; a manually-granted non-subscriber is left
 * untouched.
