/**
 * Global profile store read path with an in-memory cache.
 *
 * Per-space DBs keep only stream-scoped profile rows (comp_user/comp_info);
 * a user's profile entity lives in their own stream, so cross-stream
 * authors/members don't resolve from the per-space DB. The authoritative
 * per-user profile lives in the global `profiles` table
 * (data/global.sqlite), written by the profile fetch path
 * (insertProfiles/insertProfilesWithExtras) and the SetUserProfile
 * materialiser.
 *
 * This module resolves profile display fields (name/handle/avatar) for a set
 * of DIDs from the global store, with a short-TTL in-memory cache so the
 * per-space read hot path (getMessages/getMembers/...) doesn't hit the
 * global DB on every message.
 *
 * **Self-healing reads.** The global `profiles` table is the authoritative
 * per-user store, but it is only populated as a side effect of event
 * materialisation and the `getProfile` handler. It can be missing a row for
 * a real user (backfill/fetch failure, a freshly-cleared store, or a user
 * seen for the first time after the backfill that materialised everyone
 * else). Previously this read path silently returned a fallback (the message
 * row's own author fields) for those users — so `getMessages` could omit a
 * profile that the profile page (which hydrates on demand via HappyView then
 * Bluesky) reliably showed.
 *
 * To make reads as reliable as the profile page, DIDs that aren't in the
 * global store are hydrated on demand (HappyView-first, Bluesky fallback) and
 * written back, so a profile never needs to already be present for the read
 * path to return it. A DID that resolves nowhere is not re-fetched on every
 * read — the hydration pipeline's negative cache (materialization/profiles.ts)
 * backs it off after the first failure.
