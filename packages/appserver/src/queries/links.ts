/**
 * Link index aggregation helper.
 *
 * Serves the per-room and per-space links views (`space.roomy.room.getLinks`
 * and `space.roomy.space.getLinks`): a paginated, newest-first, URL-deduped
 * list of every shared link in a scope, each carrying the room it was shared
 * in, the message that shared it, and its enriched card (when the embed
 * enricher produced one).
 *
 * ## Data model (do not re-derive blindly)
 *
 * A link's `comp_embed_link.entity` is the URL, but that row does NOT say
 * which room the link lives in. Two distinct representations coexist:
 *
 * 1. **Body URLs** (detected from message content / richtext `#link`
 *    facets) are materialised ONCE per space: `comp_embed_link.entity` is the
 *    bare URL (via `insert or ignore`), and the link's `entities.room` holds
 *    the MESSAGE id that first shared it — not the room id. Resolving the
 *    room thus requires the two-hop join `link.room -> message.id -> msg.room`.
 *    The `comp_embed_link_data` row for enrichment is keyed by the same bare
 *    URL.
 * 2. **Attachment links** (`space.roomy.attachment.link.v0`) create a
 *    per-message encoded entity `url?message=<messageId>`, whose `entities.room`
 *    is that message id. These are the "same URL in ten messages → ten rows"
 *    case that URL dedup collapses.
 *
 * So dedup by URL is not optional: the same URL can appear under several
 * `comp_embed_link` rows when some were attachment-encoded.
 *
 * > Note: link `entities.stream_id` is `''` (see `detectAndStoreLinks`), so
 * > space scoping must filter on the MESSAGE entity's `stream_id` (= space
 * > DID), not the link entity's.
 *
 * ## Ordering key
 *
 * Rows are ordered by the containing message's `sort_idx` (a ULID of the
 * message's canonical time, falling back to the message id when `sort_idx`
 * is null) descending, tie-broken by URL. This matches the timeline ordering
 * used by `selectMessages` and `activity_item`, so "newest shared link first"
 * agrees with the message the user actually sees. `sort_idx` is preferred
 * over the message entity's `created_at` because it is the canonical,
 * move-aware timeline key (a moved message is re-keyed by its move event,
 * and edits preserve it), whereas `created_at` is the row-creation wallclock
 * that a batch materialisation skews.
 *
 * Cursor format: `"<sort_key>::<url>"` (URLs are compared verbatim; cursor
 * ties use the URL as the second key).
 *
 * The caller is responsible for filtering by read access — this helper does
 * not check permissions.
