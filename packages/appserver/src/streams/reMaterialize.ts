/**
 * Re-materialize streams from the local events DB, skipping streams that are

 *
 * Uses the `materialization_cursor` table to determine which streams need
 * replay: for each stream with events, compares the cursor's `materialized_to`
 * against the latest event idx in `stream_events`. Streams that are
 * already caught up are skipped; the rest are replayed from `cursor + 1`.
 *
 * After a schema-version wipe the cursor table is empty (all cursors default
 * to -1), so every stream is fully replayed. After a clean restart the
 * cursors are current and nothing is replayed. After a crash mid-sendEvents
 * only the un-materialized gap is replayed.

 * events are batched — read in one query and materialized in one
 * `applyBatch` call, which is the fastest path for a replay. Streams whose
 * cursor is already at the latest event idx are skipped entirely (no event
 * reads, no materialization).
 *
 * Profiles for any user DIDs referenced by profile-relevant events
 * (joinSpace / createMessage / addAdmin) are hydrated from the bsky appview
 * before the batch is applied — the live `sendEvents` path does the same, and
 * without it backfilled messages render with blank author profiles.
 *
 * Logs progress at info level. Errors for individual streams are logged but
 * do not abort the overall process — a failed stream will be re-materialized
 * on demand when first accessed.
