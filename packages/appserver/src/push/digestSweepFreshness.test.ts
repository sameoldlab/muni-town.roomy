/**
 * Digest sweep freshness gate (TASK-151).
 *
 * The other half of the flood. `selectDueDigests` returns rows whose 1h timer
 * elapsed; the sweep runs on every idle wake (60s poll) and fires one digest
 * push per row. Rows are only deleted when the user reopens the room, so a
 * backlog that accumulated across a restart — or was seeded by a replay —
 * fires the moment the process comes back, up to 64 pushes/minute of
 * hours-old messages. That deploy-coupling is what made the 2026-09-16 flood
 * look index-triggered: the rows did not exist before the replay, and the
 * deploy was simply the next restart that swept them.
 *
 * The sweep is driven directly (no loop, no wall-clock wait): the defect is
 * that the sweep had no age ceiling, and `selectDueDigests` returning a row is
 * itself still correct — asserting on the query alone would pass pre-fix.
