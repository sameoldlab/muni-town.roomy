/**
 * Roomy Pro members-area role reconciliation.
 *
 * The Roomy Space (`did:plc:gnwy2zbm3hu4gfdawzxmpb2s`) has a 'Members' role
 * (`01M2EQP9VWNQ6HBSV8CT6TEVEH`) whose dedicated channel is the members
 * area. Paying Roomy Pro subscribers should hold that role; users whose
 * subscription lapses should lose it.
 *
 * This module is a RECONCILIATION SWEEP (not a Polar webhook):
 *   - Desired set = DIDs with a live Roomy Pro subscription, read from
 *     Polar's subscriptions list endpoint (filtered to the Pro product).
 *   - The sweep writes `space.roomy.role.addMemberRole.v0` for subscribers
 *     not yet granted, and `space.roomy.role.removeMemberRole.v0` for a
 *     granted DID whose subscription has lapsed.
 *   - It is idempotent: re-running with no change writes nothing.
 *   - It is fail-safe on a Polar outage: if the desired set cannot be read
 *     (unreachable / non-200 / malformed Polar), it writes NOTHING — a
 *     stale or unknown state must never be read as "no one is paying",
 *     which would mass-remove members.
 *   - It NEVER clobbers manual grants: removal only targets DIDs this sweep
 *     itself granted and tracked (see `pro_role_grants`). A manually-assigned
 *     member who is not a subscriber is left untouched.
 *
 * It is not a general solution for derived roles — that comes with the
 * permissioned-spaces / arbiter migration. This is the temporary path for
 * the Roomy Pro members area.

/**

 * Role mutations are written via `StreamManager.sendEvents`, so they land in
 * the event log and materialize inline — identical to a client-issued
 * sendEvents batch. The writer is the appserver's own DID, read from the
 * StreamManager rather than passed in: it is the same DID the sendEvents
 * endpoint recognizes as the service self-writer, so the two can't drift.
 * Writes are chunked to `RECONCILE_BATCH_SIZE` events each.
 *
 * A Polar failure (outage / non-200 / malformed / missing `subscriptions:read`
 * scope) throws — the caller (the periodic timer / admin endpoint) decides
 * how to surface it. Critically, no role mutation is performed on such a
 * failure.
