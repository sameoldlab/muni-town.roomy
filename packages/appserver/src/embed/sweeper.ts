/**
 * Centralized embed enrichment sweeper.
 *
 * A single process-wide background loop owns ALL pending link enrichment.
 * Per-space SpaceMaterializers never fetch embeds themselves — they only
 * call {@link pokeEmbedSweeper} when new links are detected, and this loop
 * drains the global `comp_embed_link` pending set.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * Every space shares one process-wide DB, so a per-space fetch path would
 * re-read the *same global* pending list for each space on every event batch
 * (and again at startup and after backfill), fetching and erroring the same
 * URL dozens-to-hundreds of times while the embed service is slow or down.
 * Centralizing avoids all three amplifiers at once:
 *   - Exactly one in-flight fetch per URL (dedup lives in `enricher.ts`).
 *   - Every fetch has a hard timeout (see `FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`).
 *   - Bounded concurrency (see `CONCURRENCY`) — the service can't be flooded.
 *   - A self-healing idle poll catches links detected during backfill or
 *     carried over from a previous session.

// ─── Invalidation ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * After enrichment, stream the updated embed data to subscribed clients as
 * `#messageDiff` `update` ops — one frame per affected room. The client
 * patches its TanStack cache directly (no HTTP re-fetch) and the link card
 * appears the moment enrichment completes.
 *
 * `entities.room` on a link entity holds the message id that contained the
 * link (see `detectAndStoreLinks`). We resolve message → real room id via
 * the message entity's `room`, then re-select the full message snapshot
 * (which now carries the enriched `linkEmbeds` data) via `selectMessages`.
 *
 * The `update` op carries a complete `MessageDto` because the client
 * any frame missing a required field. Reactions are re-read from
 * `comp_reaction` (unchanged by enrichment); `myReactionId` is intentionally
 * omitted (broadcast diffs can't be per-user) — the client derives
 * "did I react?" from `reaction.myReactionId`, so this doesn't affect rendering.
