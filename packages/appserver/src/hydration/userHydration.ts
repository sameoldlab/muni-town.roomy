/**
 * Per-request membership hydration.
 *
 * Before a caller-scoped read can be answered, we need:
 *   1. The caller's personal stream resolved (cached or created).
 *   2. Each non-left space referenced in that personal stream identified.
 *
 * Materialization is handled inline by StreamManager when events are written,
 * so hydration only needs to resolve the personal stream and read the
 * intended spaces from the materialized DB.
 *
 * Per-user dedup: concurrent calls for the same userDid share an in-flight
 * promise to avoid N parallel personal-stream reads.
