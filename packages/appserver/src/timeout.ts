/**
 * Race a promise against a timeout. Resolves/rejects with the underlying
 * promise, or rejects with a timeout error after `ms`. The underlying promise
 * is NOT cancelled (Promises aren't cancellable) — it keeps running and may
 * eventually settle, but the caller is unblocked either way. Use this to bound
 * operations that have no built-in timeout (network RPCs, drains, etc.)
 * so a dead peer can't hang a caller indefinitely.
