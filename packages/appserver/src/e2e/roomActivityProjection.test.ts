/**
 * E2E regression test for the `room_activity` projection (TASK-175, R3).
 *
 * The projection replaces a per-board read that scanned EVERY message in every
 * room in scope to pick one per room. Its maintenance rides the per-event
 * transaction the materialiser already opens, so the thing that can silently
 * break is not the read — it is the WRITE: an event that moves a room's latest
 * message without the projection following it.
 *
 * These tests therefore drive the REAL write path (`sendEvents` → materialize →
 * projection maintenance) and then read the board the way a client does,
 * asserting that the projected read equals what the pre-projection scan returns
 * for the same fixture. Equality is the contract: the projection is an
 * optimisation, so any difference is a bug in one of them.
 *
 * Run: bun test --cwd packages/appserver src/e2e/roomActivityProjection.test.ts
