// ─── Re-materialize from local events DB ─────────────────────────────────
// Replay un-materialized events from the local events DB to bring the
// materialized views up to date. The `materialization_cursor` table tracks
// how far each stream has been materialized; streams that are already caught
// up are skipped entirely (no event reads, no materialization). A full
// replay only happens after a schema-version wipe (which empties the cursor
// table). On a normal restart the cursors are current, so this is cheap.
//
// Re-materialization is intentionally fire-and-forget: the server is already
// accepting requests, and materialized data is available immediately for
// streams that have already been processed. If the events DB is unreachable
// or empty, the server still serves requests (with whatever materialized
// state exists).
//
// Profile hydration uses the HappyView-first fetcher (HappyView → Bluesky
// fallback, or Bluesky-only when HappyView is not configured).
