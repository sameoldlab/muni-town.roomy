/**
 * Fatal-exit visibility: record *why* the process died, then die.
 *
 * Why this exists (TASK-114): on 2026-09-14 the appserver restart-looped 289
 * times in ~28 minutes (~25 minutes with `up{job="prometheus.scrape.appserver"}`
 * at 0) and not one `level="error"` line recorded a cause — so there was
 * nothing to post-mortem. Bun aborts the process on an uncaught exception or an
 * unhandled rejection, but that abort writes a raw stderr trace which never
 * reaches the app's Loki sink: the cause existed only as container stdout noise
 * and was gone when the container went away.
 *
 * Two gaps, both closed here:
 *
 *   1. `installFatalHandlers()` records the fatal through the structured
 *      logger (scope `fatal`, `fatal: true`, error name/message/stack) and then
 *      exits non-zero. Installing a `process.on` listener SUPPRESSES Bun's own
 *      abort — verified on Bun 1.3.14: a process that exited 1 on an uncaught
 *      throw kept running once a listener was installed — so the handler must
 *      exit explicitly. Returning instead would swallow the crash and leave a
 *      process serving requests in an undefined state.
 *   2. `recordProcessStart()` increments `roomy_process_starts_total` once at
 *      boot, exposing a restart loop as a scrape-visible signal in Mimir:
 *
 *        increase(roomy_process_starts_total[10m]) > 3
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: signal handling / graceful shutdown. There is no
 * SIGTERM path anywhere in `src/` (grep, 2026-09-15); the container runs under
 * `litestream replicate`, which forwards signals to Bun and leaves Bun's
 * default terminate as the shutdown. Adding one is out of scope. Nothing here
 * changes restart semantics either: the exit code is non-zero, exactly the
 * signal the abort it replaces produced, so a supervisor's restart policy
 * (`Restart=always`, Railway's restart) still restarts the process.
